"The fact is," says Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, "Medicare is going to crush the government, and if Republicans leave it unreformed then the debt picture is very, very ugly. They might never -- literally never -- show the budget reaching balance. Not in the 10-year window and not if they take their graphs out 100 years. Obama could probably show balance just past the budget window in the middle of the next decade because of the massive Medicare cuts he proposes, even if in practice they will never actually happen."
“The most amazing thing to me is that he’s hitting 100 miles per hour in almost every start,” said teammate Rick Porcello, the former Seton Hall Prep star. “Not just once in a while, but all the time.

Everybody has their own style on how they play, and if they get ready or not. We just have to come out with more fire, especially in day games. I know we're all tired, probably didn't get that much sleep. The same goes for them. You have to come out ready to play and try to get yourself real hyped three hours before the game.

When we've tried to take this series of bumps in the past at higher speeds (above 20 mph) in the regular TRD Tacoma, the results were both jarring and unnerving. It was easy to tell we were running outside the suspension setup's capabilities. However, when trying the same section in the Baja Series, the shocks made all the difference. At 20, 30 and 40 mph, the series of ruts and bumps felt like they were getting smoother. In high-range four-wheel drive, we found the best way to keep control of the Tacoma was to keep the revs high (around 3,000 or 4,000 rpm) in 2nd or 3rd gear (depending on speed) and aim for the tops of the whoops. In fact, after just a short amount of time, it was clear from the feel of the truck that it could do higher speeds as well, which we did.

I don't even talk to my neighbors because my neighbors don't talk to me. I have never been so, I guess, dishonored. My mother who is like 78, out in the yard picking stuff and people don't talk to her. I would never walk by a person who was older than me and not pay them the respect. It's almost like we are an inconvenience, like "You were here. Yes, we know you were here. But now we're here."

Childish Gambino is sitcom actor Donald Glover of "Community" in a role the man was clearly born to play -- an indie rapper. His first album, "Camp," has more laughs than your average sitcom, fueled by Glover's self-effacing swagger and a willingness to trade on the fact that a well-known Black comedian may be an odd fit for the rap game.

The IRS said today that taxpayers will have until April 17 to file their 2011 returns, thanks to two quirks of the calendar.
Barbera and Beaujolais work well with a charcuterie platter. At Noir, it's an easygoing way to eat with a few friends -- a little salami, a little coppa or prosciutto, a glass of Barbera or Tempranillo, before moving on to a serious bottle of wine.
Why did Trey Burke maybe make the right choice? Here are the last few local stars to declare early for the NBA draft:
Authentic Neapolitan pizzas --whole and unsliced, with minimal toppings --are the stars. They arrive thin and chewy-crisp, a little sour and mottled with the essential bitter black spots that signal a dance with wood fire. Flavors can be jaw-dropping --perhaps smoky paprika salami mingled with the deep tang of Hungarian pickled peppers, or shiitake mushrooms and salty pancetta set off by a whole duck egg sitting at dead center.
Hickson called herself a committed public servant. "My fidelity is to the law," she said.

Female nene use a lot of energy while nesting, and metabolically slow down to the point where they're basically "half-sleeping," he said. When cats and mongoose — a weasel like animal native to India — come along, they can easily drive nene mothers off their nests and eat their eggs.
A I wish I had words of wisdom. Long-term care insurance is among the more difficult products to decide on. It's also an evolving product that I think is heading in a good direction with intriguing hybrid policies combining life insurance or annuities with long-term care. However, these products are relatively new and complex. In the meantime, my advice on whether someone should buy a policy is essentially "it depends."

Wood's survivors include her mother and an older brother.
Except for one terrifically adroit sequence in a subway, there is nothing understated about "The Invasion." With all the shoot-outs, the screaming, the chases, collisions and fireballs, there isn't much time for storytelling (unless you count the piffle spouted during a dinner-party scene that's meant to illuminate the movie's theme), very little time devoted to the search for an antidote to the bizarre ailment (it's found with comic speed), and next to no time for the resolution. In any case, the sound and fury will keep audiences wide awake, and that's a good thing. When aliens invade, nodding off can be a risky business.
"There still hasn't been a charge," McMearn said, adding that the district attorney chose not to charge the driver.

After leaving power, De la Madrid largely steered clear of political life. He ignited controversy during a 2009 interview by expressing regret for having chosen Salinas as his successor. Salinas became a detested figure in Mexico after a new round of economic woes and widespread suspicions of corruption and criminal ties. But De la Madrid retracted his comments, saying his ill health impaired his ability to understand the question.

But my favorite was the elderly woman crankily shoving her way through the chaos: “Anybody who creates traffic like this in Midtown,” she says, rightly, “should be shot.”
Because Intel monitors its own emissions, they say, they have no assurance the data are accurate. The company's environmental permit limits annual emissions but allows occasional emission spikes that could cause respiratory ailments.

As the electronic dance-music wave crests, it’s hard to imagine what it would have felt like to hang out through all of the just concluded Miami Music Week. We spent less than 24 sleepless hours there over the weekend, and we left with our ears ringing, exhausted and wondering when we would ever want to hear “Feel So Close” again. (OK, now that we’ve slept, we’ll be happy to hear it today.)

In a state where even the Republican governor who endorsed his candidacy pleaded with legislators not to send a right-to-work bill to his desk, Romney pilloried Santorum for opposing federal right-to-work legislation. When he wasnt attacking Romney for the unpardonable sin of moderation, Santorum was denouncing champions of higher education as snobs and extolling the virtues of a government founded on the principles of evangelical Christianity.

When I went to Kayak and reverse-engineered the specific dates and flights I got at Delgado, I could indeed match their price. But most of the time I couldn't. That's because many of the agencies are consolidators, meaning they negotiate discount rates with airlines on specific routes in exchange for a promise of volume sales.
But the anecdotes were fresh to Pennsylvania voters, including Stephanie "Sam" Fleetman, the business owner who hosted Romney's visit Monday in her trucking company warehouse. She started her own trucking business with a phone line in her parents' attic, then grew it over the past 30 years to 40 employees. The vision Rubio outlined matched Fleetman's own outlook as a small-business owner, she said.

Some conservative Christian groups objected. To enact the word of God in a commercial house rather than a sacred one was to profane it. More to the point, by not addressing the divinity of Jesus, the two shows used the Bible, sincerely in their way perhaps, but for their own ends. Their Christ was clearly not the one one learned about in Sunday School.

A cousin of ceviche, but served without mounds of stringy onions, tiradito is raw fish sliced thin like sashimi and served in a delicate sauce of lime juice and aji. At Between Peruvian Cafe and Lounge in Wicker Park, the tiradito chalaca is exquisitely soft tilapia bathed in a creamy aji amarillo (yellow chili) sauce, served with a sphere of sweet potato and the huge white kernels of Peru's signature corn. I ordered it alongside the causa sampler, presented here as dollops of mashed potatoes on five spoons dressed with either chicken salad, grilled octopus or smoked salmon. On another occasion, I was dazzled by a green tamelito, its dough made of cilantro and those big white corn kernels, speared with a shrimp skewer in a spicy-sweet chili drizzle.

This led me to the decision to let them pick their own dresses. I gave them a color, and have sent emails with images of dresses that are in line with what I envision. We’ve all agreed (and so far have kept up our promise) to be honest with each other about what each bridesmaid decides. When I get out of hand —I spent a week telling my Maid of Honor sister to find something white, which would clash horribly with my ivory dress — they gently tell me to consult a color wheel. When one bridesmaid sent a link to a short, pink, bandage dress, I kindly reminded her that this is a wedding, not a girls weekend in South Beach.

Those numbers are commendable to be sure, but even more so are the driving dynamics I enjoyed while obtaining them. In the smaller Nissan Versa, for example, I averaged a very good 38.3 mpg, but that car was about as flavorful as cottage cheese. In the revamped and very well thought-out Hyundai Elantra, which is also rated at up to 40 mpg highway, I averaged 31.3 mpg. Even the latest Honda Civic I drove didn't match that, returning an observed 32.7 mpg with a less-powerful engine.

Of course, Adam's home borough was immortalized in the Beastie Boys' 1987 hit, `No Sleep Till Brooklyn,' and he never forgot where he came from with lyrics like `Open Letter to NYC's' `At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street and hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet.'

Barrett, more than likely, was focused on freeing McCleave, but perhaps he also felt the weight of the nation's future. And perhaps this is why Barrett, an experienced officer, made the mistake that buoyed the sagging rebel forces in what many consider the westernmost battle of the war.

Our owners treat all of the employees with a tremendous amount of respect and gratitude. These factors, along with the semi-rock star status of being Maitre'd of the famous Joe's of Westlake, leave me with absolutely no reason to ever leave."
Yet, even if levels of discomfort are similar among people, Hayek added: "The drugs don't work on 100 percent of the patients or 100 percent of the pain."

Omega-3 eggs were developed in 1990 by a Canadian food scientist who was looking for a way to reverse declining consumption of eggs, which had gone out of favor due to their high cholesterol content.

This could all change soon. Besides "Damsels in Distress," she'll be co-starring in the upcoming HBO series adapted from Jonathan Franzen's "The Corrections"; and in June, speaking of a young Keaton, she's co-starring in Woody Allen's "To Rome With Love." A Greta Gerwig fan might even worry, the way a fan of a smart, unaffected band would worry about that band going mainstream and playing arenas — success can strip away eccentricity. At the moment, though, certainly no one in this Chicago neighborhood recognizes her.

That’s because they no longer know Smith as a “game manager,” a label stuck to the former No. 1 overall pick when no one distinguished trait emerged in his five snake- bitten seasons before this one.

Friday night' show features Hoboken songwriting legend Richard Barone, skewed pop-rock standouts Robbers on High Street, and Dromedary-related artists Readymade Breakup and the Mommyheads. Saturday night’s bill is headlined by Stuyvesant, the local punk stalwarts whose new album came out through Dromedary last month. Saturday afternoon is dedicated to three related acts: Yung Wu, which is essentially the Feelies fronted by percussionist Dave Weckerman, Speed the Plough, which features members of Yung Wu and the Trypes, and Wild Carnation, led by Feelies bassist Brenda Sauter. Strong-voiced pop-rocker Charlotte Sometimes will also sing on that bill.
Don Wilson, Wonderland's principal, said challenging the high-performing students is a priority. For example, administrators identify some teachers' strongest subject and allow them to specialize in it — an unusual approach at the elementary level. The goal is to give students the strongest possible instruction from each of their teachers.
"I like to equate it with pizza in the United States," Chris adds. "There are so many different styles. And there's enough exotic-ness to it, that I think Americans love it."

"I think I've gotten maybe a little freer playing the piece. When I first learned it when I was about 21, I played it much more from the standpoint of a classical pianist. One of the things I've realized is, ‘Rhapsody in Blue' - unlike the traditional one cadenza that so many concertos have - has a whole bunch of them. There are several extended segments where the piano plays solo, and that allows you a certain degree of freedom."
Organizers of the Epicurean Classic say the main issue was finding a venue for the event.

Lynn Frank, the embattled head of the Sacramento County agency that oversees Child Protective Services, announced Tuesday that she is resigning.
But not all of the personnel who provided samples were at the scene of Drenth's death on Oct. 18 in a parking lot near the Union Pacific Railroad tracks at Jefferson Street and 19th Avenue, Crump said. Many of the officers who did not respond to the crime scene and were asked to provide DNA samples are under internal review for an alleged scam in which officers pocketed thousands of dollars in off-duty security work they did not perform at a low-income housing complex in south Phoenix.

It was a spectacular fall day without a cloud in the sky as Ryan was escorted to the grass in front of the mound. The problem was, he really wanted to throw off the rubber. There was some hesitation, but ultimately they let him climb the hill, toe the rubber and fire a one-hopper to Eddie Taubensee. Eddie neatly picked it out of the dirt, autographed it, shook his hand and handed him the ball.

The NBA equivalent is a guy like Don Nelson, a doughy forward on the Bill Russell Celtics that probably couldn’t play for any other team, so nobody thought of him as a human crescendo until Game 7 of the 1969 Finals. The NHL had guys like Bobby Nystrom, a hustle player better known for fist work than stick work, who one-timed a backhand past Pete Peeters to win the cup in 1980.
Self was asked after his Jayhawks walloped Texas Tech on Wednesday if the 35-point margin sent a message. After all, the Bears had won on the same floor by a mere 13 four days earlier.
Jasper's Corner Tap & Kitchen, on its nondescript edge of the Tenderloin's lodging zone, seems on quick glance to be another by-numbers hotel effort. Yet here's a confluence of Bar Stars: Kevin Diedrich, whose work at the Burritt Room caught our attention last year, and Brian MacGregor, whose concoctions at Jardiniere earned him the honor in 2010. When I walked in on a recent night, both were working - a critical mass of cocktail talent.

"We can't come out and not win games," said forward Thaddeus Young, who scored 19 points off the bench. "We have to, now."
A newer entry into the rental market is homes being rented by owners who haven't been able to sell. With information on local rental prices widely available online, these first-time landlords will likely be asking for market prices, says Jed Smith, managing director for quantitative research at the National Association of Realtors. Since their ultimate goal is to sell the property, these landlords may be more serious about maintenance of the property than a landlord who owns multiple properties, he says. So make sure a lease specifies who is responsible for taking care of—and paying for—what.
"But the important thing is that there was no bullet wound, no trauma," except that Clark’s nose was possibly broken when he fell on his desk, Grey said in a telephone interview.
Davis and Kelly were also charged with robbery in Clackamas County, Hanlon said.
While talking to some of the early golfers I was introduced to Wayne Kappelman. He is the Sharp Park Golf Course superintendent. Coming over from Harding Golf Course, he has been at Sharp Park for two and one-half years.
They're being dropped by the old — Betty White on TV Land's "Hot in Cleveland" — and the very young — Jane Levy's Tessa on ABC's "Suburgatory" — and in scripted and non-scripted shows alike. A recent episode ofBravo's new reality show "Shahs of Sunset" was titled "It's My Birthday, Bitches." Two of ABC's midseason comedies brazenly revolve around the word — "Don't Trust the B— In Apartment 23" and "GCB," which was originally titled "Good Christian Bitches." (Well, maybe not so brazenly. The network eventually decided the actual word was too incendiary for a broadcast audience.)
Interest in Egypt, Lassers said, got a boost from the latest touring exhibition of treasures from Tutankhamen's tomb. The home of the boy king retains its glitter despite terrorist attacks that killed tourists in April and July.
Street of (unsold) Dreams: Homebuilders' annual show of opulence, the Street of Dreams, still went off in 2009. But they ditched the suburban mansions in favor of already built -- and unsold -- downtown condos.

The stoppage was seen as a test of whether unions have the support to stage a full-blown general strike over labor market reforms the Socialist government says it will impose by decree very soon if the unions do not reach agreement on their own with management. The reforms are deemed critical to resurrecting Spain's moribund economy and reassuring jittery investors who have sent the government's borrowing costs soaring.
None of them have to do with pharmaceuticals, he said of the healthy habits. None of them have to do with the arrows that are flying in Washington between the Democrats and the Republicans and Obamacare, etc.
Well, OK, you say, but Olbermann isn't really a journalist; he's a commentator. And that's true. Anyone who has listened to him for five minutes doesn't have a shred of doubt where he stands. He doesn't have any objectivity to compromise. But he does operate out of a newsroom, after all, and anchored the network's Election Night coverage. And it was interesting to learn that the policy he violated was not necessarily even that he donated money to a campaign, but that he didn't receive the blessing of his bosses before he did it. (In case you're wondering, conservative Fox TV news doesn't even have that caveat regarding political donations by its staff.)
I don't really care why there were suddenly fewer people at the center, being treated more decently. I just hope it stays this way until the line is gone for good.
This outspokenness is welcome and unusual: The majority of rape victims never tell the authorities, and only 2 percent of victims who are incapacitated tell the police, according to the Department of Justice.

The bank had been evacuated before the bomb detonated, according to West Coast Bank Chief Executive Robert Sznewajs. The branch has been there for at least 10 years, he said.
"It's not so much the volume of snow that we've had. It's been that the timing of the storms has been perfect," Linde said. "They've all been good upslope storms when we benefit. If you were to sit back and say, 'I want it to snow these dates through the season to set us up for key periods,' it happened this year. You couldn't have picked it better."
“It says a lot about Chas Dodd,” Schiano said. “I said all along that we had two good quarterabacks. The weeks we prepared, he stayed ready — he cherishes every rep he gets in practice. He really came up big for us.”

Novak Djokovic dropped serve four times before beating Robin Haase, 6-4, 6-2, to reach the Monte Carlo Masters semifinals, saying he had thought about pulling out of the event following his grandfather's death.
The agency has been under fire in the past year, particularly since the July 21 death of 4-year-old Jahmaurae Allen, who had been reported to CPS in June as a possible abuse victim.

Will venture capital, hedge funds and other investors step into the void? Maybe.
Though bears have been sited in all 21 counties in New Jersey, the highest concentration is in the northwestern corner of the state, north of Route 80 and west of Route 287, said David Chanda, director of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife.
Elevation, proximity to the warm Atlantic Ocean, and intensity of the precipitation will be key players. The bulk of the storm just north and west of Route 95 will be wet snow, but even in cities from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore to Philadelphia, Trenton and New York City rain will become mixed with or change over completely to wet snow.

Remember the “supermoon” of March 2011? The full moon appeared larger than usual because of its proximity to Earth. This month’s full moon, known as the Full Flower Moon, could be almost as spectacular.
Although it seems like a modern creation, the hot-and-cold, cake-and-ice-cream concept has been around for nearly two centuries. But it was after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867 that chefs at the famed New York restaurant Delmonico's added a dessert called Alaska-Florida to their menu. By the early 1900s, this same dish of cake, ice cream, and curly clouds of meringue was featured in Fannie Merritt Farmer's "Boston Cooking-School Cook Book" as Baked Alaska.

Right now, she's cautiously developing a second season for "Girls," in case it gets picked up.
Proposition 8's backers tried to claim that the decision by then-U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker was invalid because Walker is gay. That was always a faulty argument — divorced judges rule on divorce law, judges with children decide cases in juvenile court, judges of all races resolve civil rights claims. Now, a three-judge panel of the appellate court has made it clear that the reasons for rejecting California's 2008 ban on same-sex marriage were not the result of one judge's personal situation but rather were based solidly on the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which contains the guarantee of equal protection of the law. There must be a rational basis for laws, rather than a desire to single out a particular group. During the trial, lawyers and witnesses for Proposition 8 failed to establish a valid argument in favor of the amendment to the state Constitution that limited marriage to heterosexual couples.
Scott, Thanks for your investigative report on the fair-districting amendments. No wonder voters have disdain for politicians. I hope this shifty bunch read your article and realize they are not fooling anyone. — B. Gaudet

The lovely melodies in the pastoral Andante of the Schubert bubbled along with perfect clarity (kudos to the woodwinds, by the way!). Bychkov gave the impression of being in complete control, summoning every last bit of finesse and power that this great orchestra can deliver. He is coming back next weekend to conduct the Mahler 6th, which now makes that an event where attendance is required.

Although possessed of a shattering stiff arm and an even more devastating forearm shiver, which he liked to unload on underized cornerbacks and safeties, Pryor did not relish contact to the same extent as Auburn's Cam Newton, last season's Heisman Trophy winner.

Now, U.S. Rep John Dingell, a Dearborn Democrat, has begun congressional hearings -- the first in decades -- into cosmetics safety. At least three pieces of legislation would give the FDA more enforcement power over cosmetics. Though they might not force makeup to pass safety tests before it hits store shelves, a new law could require manufacturers to register their products with the FDA and give the agency recall authority if problems arise.
Anyone who witnessed the accident is asked to contact police at (732) 988-8000 x 433.

But the real issue might be who is on the other end of those passes. Denver's receiving corps is thin, with very little in the way of proven talent beyond former first-round pick Demaryius Thomas. The leading receiver last season, Eric Decker, caught just 44 passes for 612 yards.

As part of AB 32 and other recent legislation, California is requiring businesses generating over 4 cubic yards of garbage per week to recycle. Although some might find this mandate controversial, few would argue the merits of decreasing the amount of paper, glass, plastic and especially organics still going into landfills from businesses throughout the state.

Showalter is still wavering on Saturday's starter in Toronto. It will be either Jo-Jo Reyes or Rick Vandenhurk. When Matt Angle stole second base in the 11th inning, it was the 14th straight successful steal attempt for the Orioles and the 10th on the current road trip. Thirteen of the 14 have come against the Yankees.

Austin, of the Economic Policy Institute, offers a look at a topic many don't want to broach: racial discrimination in hiring. Because teens are often looking for low-skilled, entry-level jobs, factors such as training or education often don't come into play, the disparity in their employment rates offer a chance to study such bias, he said.

John Davis, a former aide to John Edwards, testified about bungled efforts to keep the former presidential candidate's affair with videographer Rielle Hunter hidden from staff, including an awkward encounter when Hunter showed up at a hotel weeks after her work filming Edwards had ended. Hunter's contract with the campaign wasn't renewed at the end of 2006, Davis said. But in February 2007, he ran into her in an elevator at the candidate's Detroit hotel, and shortly afterward she told him she and Edwards were in love, Davis testified at Edwards' federal corruption trial.

But the plate is so full of fresh, brightly colored vegetables that I could see the argument for laying it out that way. Visual presentation is a feature of Thai cuisine  whole watermelons are often carved into a bouquet of chrysanthemums. Nearly every dish is garnished with carrot flowers or cranes and delicate ruffles of kale. Red pepper strips set off the pumpkin-colored, cream-enriched sauce.

Overall, U.S. light-vehicle sales averaged an annual rate of 14.6 million in the first quarter. At that pace, U.S. auto sales would finish 2012 with their highest total since 2007. At the beginning of 2012, many best-case scenarios had called for 14 million in sales this year. GM is expecting sales to top that level, Johnson said. Ford said it plans to update its sales forecast Wednesday, which currently calls for 13.3 million to 14.3 million light-vehicle sales.
Walker co-sponsored right-to-work legislation in 1993 as a freshman in the state Assembly, but he has declined to say whether he would sign or veto a right-to-work bill if the Legislature passed one.

So Loki (“I am burdened with glorious purpose!”) gets hold of the Tesseract and hypnotizes SHIELD agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), while Loki’s Asgardian sibling, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), joins up with the rest of the Marvel crew — including the ridiculously jut-jawed Captain America (Chris Evans) — to hash out a plan. It is the “Avengers Initiative,” and it is being run by espionage agency SHIELD’s top gun, Nick Fury. Samuel L. Jackson — sporting an eye patch, a Vandyke beard, and an uncanny ability to deliver his lines as if they were straight from a comic book’s word balloons — is Fury, charged with assembling the misfit gang of turbocharged neurotics to figure out how to thwart the Norse nemesis.

Bridgeton was hit hardest, with an EF4 tornado. It packs winds ranging from 165 to 200 mph. (An EF5 is the strongest category of tornado.) Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and Pontoon Beach near Granite City each had an EF2 touchdown - indicating 111- to 135-mph winds - and the twister in New Melle measured as an EF1, with winds from 86 to 110 mph. Forecasters believe a tornado also touched down in Maryland Heights, where they detected swirling debris on their weather radars.
Upon hearing the reaction to his comments, Valentine later apologized to Youkilis, with the disclaimer that, “I should have been more specific.

The story of immigrants arriving from overseas or relocating from the Southern states is peppered with interesting tidbits (like the $30,000 price tag for Diego Rivera's epic murals at the Detroit Institute of Arts) and stark realities, like the government-sanctioned segregation that fostered the city-suburban split. But the emphasis here is on celebrating new Detroiters from all over the world.

About 300 menehune statues were scattered throughout the resort and spotting them quickly became Hannah's favorite pursuit.

The music and media conference and festival takes place March 12-16 and is headquartered at the Austin Convention Center downtown. Most industry officials purchase badges months in advance, but walk-ups are welcome. The walk-up rate for the music portion of the convention (badges are also available for the film and interactive conferences) is $650 and theoretically gets you in to all SXSW music and media-related events. However, past experience has shown that even if you have a badge, you're not necessarily guaranteed admission to especially popular events. Capacity means capacity—and even the biggest of venues here reach it—so if there's an act you're dying to see, plan ahead and show up early.
The program paired the marshals with other law enforcement agents and churches. It set a record in Cleveland in September when more than 7,400 fugitives surrendered in a four-day event, topping the roughly 6,600 who had turned themselves in at a Detroit church hosting the program in a 2008.

Try the zucchini planks ($4.95), hand tempura-battered rounds of thin-cut veggies served with a creamy horseradish sauce. There's plenty to share among two to four guests. What Pebbles fan can turn down something called the nutty cheesy salad (small $5.95, large $8.95)? Not me. Although not identical to the salad lunch during the Pebbles reign in downtown Orlando, it was darn close. (You can check out the Pebbles original recipe today on my blog orlandosentinel.com/thedish.) What made this simple concoction of shredded fontina and Cheddar cheeses, sesame crisps, sliced olives, nuts, tomatoes and torn lettuce so great was the balance of ingredients and the kitchen at the Genuine Bistro handles the equation quite nicely in its interpretation.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega highlighted his Christian faith during his re-election bid last year, when his campaign rallies were accompanied by religious processions, chants and the campaign slogan "Christian, Socialist and In Solidarity."

Our favorite yogurt recipe comes from David Lebovitz's "The Perfect Scoop": In a large bowl, stir together 3 cups Greek-style yogurt and 3/4 cup sugar until sugar is dissolved. You can vary the yogurt fat content, but at least 1 cup of whole-milk yogurt will help the texture. (Find Greek yogurt at Trader Joe's, Costco and Whole Foods Market.) Add a teaspoon of vanilla if you'd like. Omit it if you're after the Pinkberry taste. Chill mixture one hour, then freeze in an ice-cream maker according to your machine's instructions.

In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. Those days are over. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe-haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.
--Or try mindfulness, a kind of meditation in which you sit quietly, eyes closed, and focus only on how each breath feels (in, out, in, out). When other thoughts intrude, gently refocus on breathing. After 10 minutes or so, begin to notice your surroundings as you quietly breathe. Then go about your day with this feeling of calm awareness. You'll find that pain isn't running you over. --Movement also reduces pain sensitivity. Water exercises or gentle yoga can help stop your whole body from becoming a pulsing pain generator.

So we can’t deny it. These are melancholic moments for most fans from this state, at least the ones who need some geographic validation. For many of us, this is a classic case of hathos — you know, hate/pathos, an attraction to something you really can’t stand. You love the game, but somehow hate the team for not sticking around — at least until your kids can at least decide whether it is worthy of their loyalty.

"On Sunday, Sept. 11, I went downtown to the Cleveland Pops concert. A policeman was sitting in his car, and I asked him if the concert was going to go on because it was raining. He said he had just gotten word to open up a street because the concert was canceled. Another SUV drove up and asked the same question and was turned away. On the 11 p.m. news I saw that the concert did go on. I was very upset and really wanted to go to it. Also I would like to moan about all the parking meters with orange covers on them saying 'no parking.' Why do they do that?

I gained a newfound appreciation for airport security. I painfully understood when a guard threw away my expensive shampoo. I took the time to master the art of packing toiletries in a sandwich bag and limiting my luggage to one suitcase and a purse. I wear easy-to-slip-off shoes to smooth the walk through security. I quit wearing bobby pins in my hair after an expensive updo was undone by security. And I didn't freak out over the full-body scans. X-ray me. Do what you must to keep us safe.

The city struggles to adapt to its peculiar topology and legacies of industrial pollution while seeking to be a steward of prominent natural resources such as the Sandy and Columbia rivers. In particular, Troutdale has shown itself to be a smart player in managing some nasty brownfield sites whose hard use preceded environmental regulation by decades. A prime example is the conversion of the former Alcoa aluminum plant campus near I-84, once a toxic Superfund site, to the current FedEx regional hub -- a sensible, comparatively clean and profitable use of the land.

"The Kid With a Bike" is another empathetic film by Jean- Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the brothers from Belgium who have strong sympathy for alienated children and young people, and who avoid melodrama and sensation in telling their stories so movingly.

They prefer the drama of ordinary life, in which for a boy like Cyril things don't easily go right. In straightforward, realistic scenes, they show a boy who fears he has been thrown away, but persists in feeling that his father only lost him and will be happy to find him again.

I don't think the Buffs can win with in-state talent alone; they still need that influx from other areas. However, year after year, we see kids that the Buffs passed on and are playing elsewhere. They must be doing something right. D.J. Davis played (and played well) for Oregon in the National Championship; I don't recall the Buffs giving him a sniff. Hopefully, Coach Embree can at least change some of it. Ditto for Colorado State and Air Force. I would enjoy watching those rosters filled more with local talent.

Anyone we’ve interview, we ask them what games are you playing now, what are your favorite games of all time and why? What flaws have you found in them?

This is a devastating portrait. At times, the U.S. health care system delivers the worst of both worlds: pay more, get less. Unfortunately, the message isn't new. America's fragmented and overspecialized health system maximizes returns to providers -- doctors, hospitals, drug companies -- but not to society. Fee-for-service reimbursement allows providers to reconcile their ethical duty (more care for patients) and economic self-interest (higher incomes). The more they do, the more they earn. Restraints are few, because patients and providers both resist limits on their choices. Government regulators and private insurers are too weak to control costs.

We worked really, really hard on establishing the run game early and then we've really had a big emphasis on the passing game. ... We're putting them in a lot of different situations.

... You may form an idea of how quickly the city was placed under martial law when I say that that day about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to a corner grocery at Octavia and Geary for a bottle of wine for one of the girls at the house who was a nervous wreck and could not eat a morsel, and was informed by the grocer that he could not sell it to me as the penalty was death.

The result -- more vicious acid reflux symptoms than those that may have prompted their use in the first place -- often drive patients back to the pills, setting up a cycle of long-term dependence, Public Citizen's petition states.

The white man who could do it was exceptional. Freeth determined that if the old natives had been able to do the trick there was no reason that he could not do the same. In a short time he mastered the feat and then went further. The older inhabitants told of natives in the early days who stood on their heads when they came in. Freeth soon proved that this could be done at the present time as well as before."

When Americans bring their crude impatience and impossible expectations of democracy and freedom to that forge, disappointment is inevitable. We are defeated in Afghanistan, as we should be, for our arrogance and "bull in a china shop" attitude. This should be our lesson well-learned.

After Vice Mayor Madison Nguyen made the initial motion to approve the measure, Councilman Pete Constant followed with a substitute motion that tightened some language and added a request from Councilman Sam Liccardo aimed at thwarting union legal challenges. That move blocked any other potential substitute motions by Councilmen Ash Kalra, Kansan Chu and Don Rocha, all of whom suggested alternatives during the three-hour meeting. Kalra and Chu ultimately joined Xavier Campos in opposing the measure. But Rocha, a swing vote, noted the effectiveness of the parliamentary maneuver as he sought in vain to modify the measure and realized his only option was begging Constant to allow "friendly amendments."

At the time, I worked in downtown Portland and usually I commuted by bus. I believe the light-rail system is beneficial in several ways. It helps the environment by getting some cars off the road. It helps relieve traffic congestion and is convenient for people to use. That's all good stuff. But is now the right time to implement such a huge and costly ($1.5 billion) project with government agencies and schools claiming multimillion-dollar budget shortfalls?
Burch-York was among four or five adults meeting with the boy in a room on the building's first floor, officials said. Someone pressed a panic button that signaled security officers, but people in the room restrained the boy before security arrived.
The poor Red Sox must have felt like they were facing two aces today. First was the Verlander who relied heavily on his slider as he went through the Red Sox lineup. Then came the Verlander who complements his high-90s heat with nasty curveballs. He threw two straight curves to Red Sox shortstop Mike Aviles in the eighth inning that were so good, they were almost offensive. Aviles somehow managed to hit the second one for a soft lineout to shortstop. I might give Aviles some All-Star votes for that.

We just have to find that team, find that energy again. When I first came here, I thought we were as good as any team I've been on. And I've averaged 50 wins the last two years. We just need to find that magic again."

"We saw she has tremendous stamina and heart and toughness, and we said that she's a perfect candidate to move to the intermediate hurdles," McKenzie said. "It turned out to be exactly the right move. You don't get a scholarship for running a 12.9, 12.8 in the 100 meters. But if you can take that good speed and put it in a technical event, now you can possibly be a scholarship athlete."
"There are thousands of other players who will tell you the same thing. The administration is under the belief that if they hire an NFL coach, or someone flashy, that they will fill seats," Short said in phone interview Thursday.

29. Jack Gregory, DE, 1966, 9/139, Delta State, 1967-71, 1979. A superb pass rusher who made second-team all-pro twice. Gregory and backup cornerback Freddie Summers were traded to the Giants for first- and second-round picks in the 1973 draft. The Browns spent the first-rounder on wide receiver Steve Holden, who totaled 62 career catches, but got star running back Greg Pruitt with the second pick.

"I have been the one who has publicly, along with the president, been very, very critical of some of our European allies for not fully embracing Turkey in the economic union, for not fully embracing Turkey as part of Europe.

Even the fiercest critics of our pro-Israel policy concede that we get invaluable intelligence from its matchless espionage service, the Mossad. Israelis know more about fighting terrorism than anyone else and have top human-intelligence sources in every country in the Middle East -- something our CIA only dreams about.

MINIMIZE SHOPPING. Before you buy anything, apply the "six-month rule" I previously posted. Ask yourself, "If I buy this, where will it be in six months: in use or put aside on a shelf somewhere?" All too often, something that looked "cute" on vacation becomes a white elephant once you get home.

The two-story modern home has a lower-level entry with an open, winding wooden staircase leading up to the main living quarters. Vaulted wood beam ceilings and clerestory windows give the living/dining area an open and airy feel.

The SEC proposal is expected to include two elements that worry fund companies. The plan would allow investors who wish to sell all their holdings in a money-market fund to receive only 95% to 97% of their cash immediately and the rest after 30 days.

In 1966, Texas Western, a relatively small college of mining and metallurgy, stormed to the national collegiate men's basketball championship over Adolph Rupp's vaunted University of Kentucky Wildcats. It's a terrific story of a team of Davids with hoop dreams running a gantlet of patrician Goliaths against a backdrop of momentous social change. The Miners, led by Coach Don Haskins, counted an unprecedented seven African Americans in its lineup, including the starting five in the final game, and changed the sociological makeup of the sport, paving the way for the integration of the major southern collegiate sports conferences.

Wien is calling for oil to fall to $85 a barrel, for gold to return to $1,800 or for stocks to surpass 1,400 as measured by the S&P 500. Some of these would seem to be mutually exclusive.

You're out there in the arena and your adrenaline's flowing -- you're getting hit and hitting back, and you're sort of going back and forth. It’s different than being on the sidelines and seeing the people, the person that you love, getting hit. It hurts more. And so it was a little tougher for Karen and the kids. They did an amazing job as they always have in standing behind me in every sense of the word."

Q: Hey, Brian: If Dan Gilbert knew LeBron James was going to leave, would Mike Brown have been fired? Would it have led to Danny Ferry quitting?

muckduck: The Ducks can now begin their dominance as an official ELITE team with that 2012 Rose Bowl win and DAT is going to be a HUGE part of this unreal offense next year!!! Samurai7: Besides the two long runs for touchdowns untouched, DAT picked up a key first down beating a defender well short of the first down marker, which set up the winning touchdown. Also, He and Barner were the "gunners" on the punt with 22 seconds left going downfield making the fair catch necessary and creating a long field! hermtownhomy: DAT definitely stood out, but that does not mean he should be singled out as the only reason they won. He is scary fast. Probably the fastest player in football right now and we all look forward to the future with him, but his two runs were not necessarily turning points in the game. They still could have gone on to score if those two runs hadn't happened. True turning points in the game were the interception and fumble recovery. I just don't agree with JC's point here that DAT was the reason they won. It was a team effort. RipCityDroHead85: De'Ant was prolly the MVP, I'd agree, but LaMike and Darren had pretty good games too, along with Tuinei. As far as that best duck ever, I don't know if i'd be heaping that much praise on him just yet, LaMike made a key block that sprung one of his long ones. No mention of the best duck rb ever out there blocking for another rb. portlandchiro1: I agree with the praise heaped on De'Anthony, but lets not get carried away. This was a full team win with many stars contributing. Where would Oregon have been without the two forced turnovers from the defense-including the unbelievable interception by Kiko Alonzo? How about the catches by Tunei, the grueling runs by LaMichael James, the touchdown catch by Barner, and on and on on. This was a team win and there are many heroes. Bravo to all the Ducks!!! What was your favorite moment from the Rose Bowl? What about next season are you most excited for? Post your thoughts below.

She actually asked Tony Lucca's toddler daughter who she was voting for? Unless we all scream for ice cream gets polled, this poor child is not qualified to vote for anything. Is there no dunderheaded question that Milan is unwilling to ask? No, I say to you.

Lloyd: I don’t know if the rest world will ever catch up to me because I don’t know where the hell I am most the time. If you notice, almost every TV commercial lately has ukulele in it. The ukulele is now being taken more seriously. It’s not a just novelty instrument or a1920’s nostalgia trip, but an important member of the string family used in classical, jazz, folk, rock, etc. I like Tiny Tim but enough of the “Tiptoe Through the Tulip” requests. That’s like a guitarist getting, “Dude, play Freebird!” (which I get as well). But it’s no surprise to me that more people are getting turned on to the pure sound of the ukulele. That’s why I love it so much - it has a weak sound but in the right hands it can sound powerful. I think because rock music relied so heavily on the guitar, you figure at some point it may have been stretched to the limit. But making folk or orchestra instruments as lead rock instruments could have endless possibilities in that genre. I hope to hear more in the future. As for the Jew’s harp, the other uke player in Lloyd United, Riri Hamilton, plays a mean one.
At Kukje, the in-house seasoning includes Korean red pepper powder, sugar, homemade anchovy sauce, garlic, green onions, julienned daikon and fresh oysters, mixed to the consistency of a moist paste.

Then the red-tinged cabbages are packed tightly in jars, transferred to the walk-in refrigerator, and left to ferment for five days.

A: You know, you pause (laughs). And you sort of gather your breath and you walk into the scene, for sure. But once again, I knew that it's there for a reason. Again, it's the trust thing with Steve, and the partners you're playing with. It's not there for titillation or exploitation. It's there to sort of get inside this guy's head and reveal to the audience various aspects of the condition he's in.
"No matter how much we could raise privately, it would still be a small percentage of the overall money we spend.

Experts seem to agree that there are six elite players at the top of this draft. The No. 6 slot might lose some value to the Rams if cornerback Morris Claiborne or running back Trent Richardson fell to that spot after Blackmon and Matt Kalil. The Rams already have veterans in the lead RB and CB roles, so that might prompt the front office to trade down out of the pick for additional assets. Or the Rams could move up IF the football staff falls in love with Blackmon. How the staff assesses these high-end prospects during the weeks ahead should help Jeff Fisher and Les Snead chart their course.

As the wave of revolution continues to sweep through the Arab world, the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad could be its next victim.

For his affogato, Spella pours a double-shot over Stella's super-creamy stracciatella (vanilla with chocolate chips) or a sensual hazelnut gelato fashioned with Oregon hazelnut butter. The results taste like some new coffee ice cream off the atomic charts.

Israel, for example, could announce that it would be willing to return the entire Golan Heights — providing Israel's security and water concerns were taken into consideration — to a Syrian regime that was genuinely democratic, if that regime signed a peace treaty with Israel incorporating trade, tourism and diplomatic relations. (As former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir once said, "I will know that there is a real peace with Syria when I can go shopping in Damascus.") To be sure, many Israelis, remembering Syrian forces firing down on the Galilee from the Golan Heights before the 1967 war, would be loathe to give up the Golan. Nonetheless, the security benefits to Israel of a Syria that has broken its ties with Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas would be well worth the return of the Golan.

And 11 months later, the "original" Browns played their last game in Cleveland before owner Art Modell moved the franchise to Baltimore. Since returning in 1999, the Browns have played just one playoff game, losing to Pittsburgh aver the 2002 season.
What left many Maryland fans I know counting the days until next season begins– unlike football fans who are still trying to figure out whether or not to dump or renew their tickets – was a recruiting class that got another boost this week and the manner in which the Terps seem to respond Turgeon’s blunt and often blistering critiques.
In 1912, the "State Fish Car" -- a railroad car -- was wheeled down the tracks to Waconia, containing an estimated 2.25 million northern pike fry, all of which were dumped into the lake. Ten years and millions more fry later, the effort paid off: A man named A.J. Schutz boated an 11-pounder.

As reporters swarmed Bales' neighborhood late Friday, Holland and other neighbors shook their heads, trying but failing to reconcile the man they thought they knew with the allegations against him. Military officials say that at about 3 a.m. last Sunday, the 38-year-old staff sergeant crept away from the Army base where he was stationed in southern Afghanistan, entered two slumbering villages and unleashed a massacre, shooting his victims and setting many of the bodies on fire. Eleven of those killed belonged to one family. Nine were children.

Most likely to contribute early: Kelechi Osemele. The Ravens waited until the second day of the draft to finally address their most pressing offseason need: the offensive line. They lost Ben Grubbs in free agency and missed out on Evan Mathis, who re-signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, leaving a big question mark at left guard. This versatile, athletic lineman will compete for a spot in the starting lineup right away, either battling Jah Reid for the left guard spot or getting in the mix at tackle (he would be a right tackle, but there are potentially moving parts there in Bryant McKinnie and Michael Oher).
Without much game film to see, the coaches relied more on technique and desire to evaluate Youngblood-Ary.
That world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful. I’ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts of once busy Main Streets. I’ve heard it in the frustrations of Americans who’ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear – proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.

A riff on Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 drama "A Raisin in the Sun," "Clybourne Park" tells its acid tale in two acts. The first act focuses on the family selling their house in Chicago's Clybourne Park house to the Younger family, who will be the first black family in the neighborhood; the neighbors try to stop the sale. Act Two picks up 50 years later, when Clybourne Park - by now a black community - is ripe for gentrification, and a white couple wants to buy the same house for themselves.

HYDRAULICS: Hydraulics and the sensation of being elevated and descending can be experienced in elevators, hospital beds and even on some wheel chairs. Since the latter two may be difficult to come by ask your friends if they know someone who lives in pet-friendly building with an elevator. Take the puppy into the elevator, offer it a treat, go up one floor and treat the whole way. Go back down treat the whole way. Repeat this process so that your puppy becomes desensitized to the hydraulic motion of the elevator. When that is achieved withhold treats until you reach the first floor. When you arrive, treat. Descend and treat when you arrive. You may also ask your vet if you can borrow one of his hydraulic tables for just this purpose. When using a hydraulic table make sure it is elevated only a few inches during each repetition. In an elevator the animal can't see objects becoming smaller as the table is lifted above them. He can on a hydraulic table, so this must be taken slowly to achieve the best results.

"If we beat QPR, we will be the champions," he said. "But at this moment, we can't think about this. We need to prepare very well for the next game, only this. I am excited because we are on the top, but it's not enough. One week more and if we play like we did today, we have a lot of chance to win."
Going into the next game, the key for us is not being overconfident, knowing that what we did Sunday was miraculous. We can’t do that again. We just have to play with the same effort and heart that we played with in the fourth quarter and we’ll be in a better position to win.

The top four seeds receive home-ice advantage, and for the Blues, who are 26-4-4 at Scottrade Center and 14-13-3 on the road, that could be critical.

The iPro is designed much like a conventional interchangeable lens system. The kit includes a wide-angle lens and a fisheye that provides a circular 160-degree view. They're bayonet-style lenses: they click firmly into a mount on a special case that your iPhone needs to wear. When the lenses aren't in use, they stow safely inside a screw-together cylinder that's sturdy enough to protect them against any degree of abuse. The cylinder also screws into the iPhone case and can serve as a handle (to stabilize video), or provide a standard tripod mount.

Congress has passed various restrictions on U.S. aid in Pakistan after Osama bin Laden was found hiding within its borders.

What makes this agreement with the Afghans important is that it acknowledges that the U.S. has to be involved in Afghan stabilization — in one form or another — for the long term.

A precursor to SB 1070 passed the Legislature as early 2006, but then-Gov. Janet Napolitano vetoed it. Pearce now is contemplating a bill that would deny birth certificates to Arizona-born children of illegal immigrants.

In appointing a special prosecutor, Toomin wrote that the public's perception of impropriety matters most. By making Webb the special prosecutor, Toomin made clear that he considers the matter grave.

In saying that, Claiborne’s test score was NOT a true indicator of his intelligence. He can and does learn.

Let me give you an example of a case in which I think the IRS really blew it. We reported a Baptist church in northern Arkansas back in 2004 where the pastor has held a service on Independence Day. Part of the church's service even included registering voters registration (no problem with that). However, the pastor gave a sermon while flanked by two large screens.

Still the role of environmentalism is not to bargain away any landscape but rather to defend them all.

Dr. Hoffmann says for many high-risk patients like Coleman, it's safer to use general anesthesia administered through an IV because the levels of sedation are more precise.

We had reached Millau, home of the Viaduct, completed in 2004 and one of the world's tallest bridges. It towers high above the Tarn Valley.

If I were a player, it would drive me crazy. It would keep me up at night. But the professional mindset doesn't allow that. After any game, Shark forward Joe Pavelski can recite just about every shot he's taken and all the particulars, but he does so with an almost detached clinical detail. Same thing with teammate Patrick Marleau.

Looking like a cross between a 1970s wood-paneled lodge and a bar lined with hundreds of bottles, the set somehow summons the Parisian cafés and Pamplona bullrings where the action takes place. We're in the mid-'20s, but everybody's dressed in vaguely modern clothes that don't suggest any particular era.

“I’m not surprised he’s not running again because the word on the street was that he wasn’t re-electable,” Olson said of Hoffman. “It’ll be good for the city to have a new mayor and someone who isn't such a lightning rod for this divisiveness that has been pervasive in our community for the last few years."

When he gets to the M page and finds out it's "M is for Mouse," Moose goes ballistic and rampages through the rest of the book, stomping on the pie on the P page and overturning the queen on the Q page. Finally, Zebra takes pity on him and invites Moose to share his page, as "Z is for Zebra's friend, Moose." There's lots to look at and laugh over in Zelinsky's comic illustrations - including a gag on the cover: Lift the jacket and you'll see the "normal" cover with "Z is for Zebra" before Moose butted in with his own sign. This is hooves down the most fun alphabet book in years.

A white Burgundy from France is one of my all-time favorite combinations with a perfectly roasted chicken. This dinner will mark the first time that I veer away from Burgundy with my pairing.

Daria Krivolapov, 20, of Clifton, visiting with a group of friends, held up an "Occupy Gothem (sic.)" sign.
Upset special: … then there’s the N.C. State-Kansas matchup. Let’s just put it this way—the seed differential (KU is the region’s No. 2 seed, N.C. State is the 11) is much greater than the talent differential. The Wolfpack played a tough schedule—a huge reason they got an at-large bid—and played most of those teams very well, but just couldn’t pull out many of those close games. In the Tournament, they’ve figured out how to win, with victories over sixth-seeded San Diego State and third-seeded Georgetown. Nobody doubted former coach Sidney Lowe’s ability to recruit upper-tier talent, and those players are producing results—finally, Wolfpack fans might add—for first-year coach Mark Gottfried. Future NBA lottery pick C.J. Leslie has been playing the best basketball of his career down the stretch, and he’s just one of five players averaging double figures in scoring. This is a tough, tough matchup for the Jayhawks.

"NOAA early warning systems provide critical information to residents and emergency managers so that evacuations and emergency preparations can begin promptly," the senators' letter said. "Last March, these early warnings provided first responders with adequate time to reinforce sea walls, sandbag low-lying areas and take other precautionary measures -- these measures were effective at minimizing the loss of life and property during this catastrophic event.

It's why the G should be on your must-drive list if you're shopping for a luxury sedan that's engaging to drive. There's that connection to the road when you're in the driver's seat that's difficult for automakers to create, but which is instantly recognizable. A combination of minimal body roll, a rear-wheel-drive platform, and nicely weighted, responsive steering deserve much of the credit. Even with all-wheel drive, the G25x retains the feel of a rear-drive sedan.

In the other direction the fire was creeping toward Chinatown, at once the plague spot and the wonderland of San Francisco. When the flames reached this district, it ignited like kindling wood. It covered over seven or eight blocks, but ten thousand people were packed in it. It was said to be fairly honey-combed with human habitations underneath. Of all the suffering from the fire, I think the despised Chinese faired the worse, for they were the poorest and no American homes were open to them. It was from Chinatown that most of the dead bodies were taken, and no doubt untold numbers are still lying under the debris. Probably, many of them were opium fiends, who were too stupified to make their escape from these underground death-traps.

It's all part of an overall theme of uncertainty and regret, one that is best expressed by Kindermann's musings on his life's work, about what he views as "a peculiar irony at work in the world: what you lack will always be magnified by the people and events that constitute your life.

A woman who feels no kindness for her children will see, everywhere she goes, mothers and fathers fawning over their babies. So it was with him. He'd gravitated to a career as a summer camp director. All his life he'd been exasperated by other people's unwise longings."

The Texas Supreme Court has given us a needless opinion in which no one wins. The public, certainly, has lost.

Despite the unapologetic nature of the GT-R, it's hard to argue with the sheer value the car presents. Plenty of ink has been spent debating the merits of this car versus the aforementioned Corvette and Porsche. $100,000 can buy you a version of one of the three that will undoubtedly put a smile on your face. The difference lies in the widely varied way each car draws out said smile. Where the GT-R trumps the others is how it is the only one of the three that has nearly all of the capabilities and physicality of a high-end supercar. For better or worse.

Norris' jazz riff on themes within pioneering 1959 drama "A Raisin in the Sun" requires no prior familiarity with Lorraine Hansberry's classic (although Center Theater Group has made that easier to obtain by simultaneously presenting the splendid Ebony Rep revival on Culver City's sister Kirk Douglas stage).
